The Elements Inner HTML
Every elements inherits properties and methods from the element interface. This means every element has an .innerHTML property. We can use this property to:-
* get an element's HTML content
* set an element's HTML content
The .innerHTML property returns a string which is called the DOMString.

An Element's Text content.
The .textContent property will
* set the content of an element and all its descendants.
* returns the text content of an element and all its descendants.

An Elements's text content version 2
The .textContent Property, the .innerTextproperty can be used to get/set element's text content, but there are some differences.

.textContent sets/gets the text content of an elment. all the text, regardless of CSS properties.
.innerText, on the other hand, is a little thicker , it returns only what is visible.

Adding new content to the page. 

The CreateElement property.
The createElement is the property of the document object which allows us to create new elements.
You can use the .appenndChild method to add to the element to the page. 
.appendChild() needs an element. It must be called on an existing element. 
The appendChild method will move the element from its current position to the new one.

Creating text nodes.    
We can create new text nodes using the method .createTextNode() method.     
Insereting HTML in other locations.

The .insertAdjacentHTML()method has to be called with two arguments:-
    - The location of the HTML 
    - the HTML text that is going to be inserted.

The first argumenbt allows us to put the text in four different locations
* beforebegin * afterbegin * beforeend * afterend

Remove Content 
Removing a child 
we can use .removeChild() method to remove a child. This method requires
    - a parent element
    - the child element that will be removed
The drawback of this method is that it requires access to the parent function. 

There is another method that is cxapable of doing that and it is .remove()
